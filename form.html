<h2>HTML Forms</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
<p>Let’s look at some simple examples:

This is for you. → This is intended for you. → Esto es para ti.
It happened for that reason. → It happened because of that reason. → Pasó por esa razón.
They have something for my mom. → They have something intended for my mom. → Tienen algo para mi mamá.
They paid him for his work. → They paid him because of his work. → Le pagaron por su trabajo.
As you can see, these buckets work really well. Most of the time, if you can replace "for" with "intended for," it’s para. If you can replace it with "because of," it’s por.

Try it yourself in a few examples. By using these buckets (“because of” versus “intended for”), I bet you can get por versus para right in all of these!

That was for them. → Eso era ____ ellos.
We have something for her. → Tenemos algo ____ ella.
These things happen for a reason. → Estas cosas pasan ____ una razón.
The gift is for me. → El regalo es ____ mí.
Did you pay for this? → ¿Pagaste ____ esto?

<p>If you click the "Submit" button, the form-data will be sent to a page called "/action_page.php".</p>
<p>This is for you. → This is intended for you. → Esto es para ti.
It happened for that reason. → It happened because of that reason. → Pasó por esa razón.
